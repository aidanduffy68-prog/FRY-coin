October 10, 2024: $19B liquidations.

I'd been building a decentralized alternative. Deployed the day before.

FRY Protocol: Process losses on-chain. Chainlink-verified prices. No centralized exchange.

Will it replace what you're using? Probably not.

But it exists: https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/

**Even shorter (Twitter-length):**

$19B liquidations on Oct 10.

I deployed FRY Protocol the day before - decentralized liquidity infrastructure with Chainlink oracles.

It won't replace centralized exchanges. But it exists.

**Ultra-short (for comments):**

Built a decentralized alternative. Deployed Oct 9. Crash happened Oct 10.

Bad timing or good timing? Either way, it's live: https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/
